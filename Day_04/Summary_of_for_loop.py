# 1. for loops iterate over a sequence, such as list, tuple, or string, excluding a block of code for each item.
# 2. The range() functions is often used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers, facilitating iteration over a set number of steps.
# 3. Loop control statements like break and continue can alter the flow of a loop, with break existing the loop and continue skipping to the iteration.
# 4. enumerate() will allow you to access both the index and the element from a list inside the for loop.
