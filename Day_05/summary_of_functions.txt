## Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses, which may include parameters.

## Parameters allow functions to receive inputs, making them flexible and reusable for different data input.

## The return statement is used to send a function's result back to the caller, exiting the function and optionally passing back a value.

## Default parameters in function definitions provide default values for arguments, simplifying function calls and enhancing flexibility.
